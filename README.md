# Lean Formalisation of POSIX Submatching

This repository contains the formalisation of Sulzmann and Lu's derivative-based
POSIX submatching algorithm.

## File Overview
- `Regex`: definition of regexes, Brzozowski derivatives, and Sulzmann and Lu's
  algorithm.
- `POSIX`: definition of POSIX specification for submatch environments.
- `Correctness`: correctness of submatching algorithm with respect to POSIX
  definition.
- `Examples`: running examples of the submatching algorithm.
